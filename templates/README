These Visual Studio 2013 templates demonstrate how to create different types of Windows applications for OpenGL ES.

To add these templates to your installation of Visual Studio 2013:
    1)  Browse to your Visual Studio 2013 custom project templates folder. By default, this is 
        located here:
            %userprofile%\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Templates\ProjectTemplates
    2)  Create a subdirectory called "Store Apps" (if it doesn't already exist), and create a 
        subdirectory within that called "Universal Apps".
    3)  Copy the 'Universal' template directories (as found in this README's directory) into this 
        "Universal Apps" directory.
    4)  Return to the \ProjectTemplates directory from Step 1, and create a subdirectory called 'Win32'
    5)  Copy the 'Desktop' template directories (as found in this README's directory) into this 'Win32' 
        directory.
    6)  Restart/Launch Visual Studio 2013, and then go File -> New Project -> Visual C++. The templates 
        should be available under 'Store Apps\Universal Apps' and 'Win32'.

Before you can build a project based on these templates, you must:
    1)  Clone an ANGLE repository that includes WinRT support (if you haven't already done so).
    2)  Set the 'AngleRootPath' system environment variable to the location of your ANGLE source.
    3)  Open one of the following solution files to build Windows Store 8.1 compatible ANGLE binaries:
            $(AngleRootPath)\projects\winrt\windows\src\angle.sln
            $(AngleRootPath)\projects\winrt\windowsphone\src\angle.sln
        and build the flavors of ANGLE that you wish to use in your project created above, 
        e.g. Release/ARM/WindowsPhone.
