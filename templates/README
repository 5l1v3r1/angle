These Visual Studio 2013 templates demonstrate how to create different types of Windows applications
for OpenGL ES.

Template descriptions:
    1) UniversalSwapChainPanel - for Windows Store (PC and Phone), uses XAML
    2) UniversalCoreWindow     - for Windows Store (PC and Phone), no XAML
    3) DesktopHelloTriangle    - for classic Windows desktop

Requirements:
    1)  Visual Studio Community 2013 (Update 4), or higher/later

Template installation instructions:
    1)  Browse to your Visual Studio 2013 custom project templates folder. By default, this is 
        located here:
            %userprofile%\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Templates\ProjectTemplates
    2)  Create a subdirectory called "Store Apps" (if it doesn't already exist), and create a 
        subdirectory within that called "Universal Apps".
    3)  Copy the 'Universal' template directories (as found in this README's directory) into this 
        "Universal Apps" directory.
    4)  Return to the \ProjectTemplates directory from Step 1, and create a subdirectory called 'Win32'
    5)  Copy the 'Desktop' template directories (as found in this README's directory) into this 'Win32' 
        directory.
    6)  Restart/Launch Visual Studio 2013, and then go File -> New Project -> Visual C++. The templates 
        should be available under 'Store Apps\Universal Apps' and 'Win32'.
        
Building/configuring ANGLE to use in the templates:
    1)  Clone an ANGLE repository if you haven't already done so.
    2)  Set the 'AngleRootPath' system environment variable to the location of your ANGLE source.
    3)  Open one of the following solution files to build Windows Store 8.1 compatible ANGLE binaries:
            $(AngleRootPath)\projects\winrt\windows\src\angle.sln
            $(AngleRootPath)\projects\winrt\windowsphone\src\angle.sln
        Or use the following solution file to build classic Windows desktop compatible ANGLE binaries:
            $(AngleRootPath)\projects\src\angle.sln
    4)  Build the flavors of ANGLE that you wish to use, e.g. Release/ARM/WindowsPhone.
        
Now create a new project based on one of the templates. When you build your project, it should 
automatically pick up the correct ANGLE binaries and successfully deploy to your chosen device.
