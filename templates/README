These Visual Studio 2013 templates demonstrate how to use OpenGL ES in different types of Windows applications.

To add these templates to your installation of Visual Studio 2013:
    1)  Browse to your Visual Studio 2013 custom project templates folder. By default, this is located here:
            %userprofile%\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Templates\ProjectTemplates
    2)  Create a new subdirectory called "OpenGL ES".
    3)  Copy the templates (as found in this README's directory) into the new "OpenGL ES" subdirectory.
    4)  Restart/Launch Visual Studio 2013. Then go File -> New Project -> Visual C++ -> OpenGL ES, and create your project.

Before you can build a project based on these templates, you must:
    1)  Clone an ANGLE repository that includes WinRT support (if you haven't already done so).
    2)  Set the 'AngleRootPath' system environment variable to the location of your ANGLE source.
    3)  Open the following solution file:
            $(AngleRootPath)\projects\src\winrt\angle.universal.sln
        and build the flavors of ANGLE that you wish to use in your project created above, e.g. Release/ARM/WindowsPhone.
